            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SInce it is in a manner as unfaſhionable to write without a Preface, as it is to Dance before you have firſt made your Honours; ſo it may be as moroſe to urge the Reader to jump at once from the Title page into the Book, without leading him thither Modiſhly by a Preface; tho' otherwiſe the Title page it ſelf might have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyd that.</p>
            <p>When an infamous Rumor has once taken place in the minds of the Publique, it's as difficult a matter to remove the impreſſion, as to confute a Bigot in his firſt received Opinion of Religion; the nature of the one aſpiring to judge, being prone to Poſitiveneſs and Cenſure, is as ready to condemn upon falſe information, as on the other ſide to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud and cry up a perſon for ſome great Merit, that never deſerved it: ſo the other ſhall, for want of Arguments, ſtand up, Rail and Redden, nay venter his life, and fight for that which he knows no more of then the Game-Cock when car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd

                  <p>THough Capt. <hi>Gregorye</hi>'s modeſty will not give him leave to ask any gratuity for his Soldiers ſervice, yet I hope your diſcretion will tell you what he may expect upon this occaſion; and I hope what his extraordinary Civility forbids him to ask, your Gratitude will make you give him; he has ſent away the Bagg of Sugar, having the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of a Guard But he ſetts a very ſmall value upon it; If you deliver two Firkins of Lymejuice to his Serjeant, and what ever elſe you think worth his acceptance, it will come ſafely to his hands; The Captain of the Ship ſays, there are Sweetmeats Chocolett and Jamaica Peper and Ginger aboard; But I need not adviſe you in this caſe, You that have been ſo much converſant in thoſe things, need not to be at a loſs what to do; only I take leave to tell you as a friend, that as you may incur his Favour by this, So you may his Diſpleaſure, by the neglect of it, which

            <p>It's very evident what unjuſt errands the Capt. and Mr. <hi>Bland</hi> went upon the day before, when they viſited Mr. <hi>Orpen</hi> and Mr. <hi>Crump</hi> on board the Ship, which, though (as the Letter ſpeaks,) baſhful to ask for, yet they bluſh not to write for, next day; Mr. <hi>Orpen,</hi> returned this anſwer, That the Soldiers muſt be paid if they did any ſervice; And as caſes ſtood, he would not diſpoſe of any thing; but hop'd that in a little time, a diviſion would be made; And as ſoon as he had his ſhare Set out, which was due to him for Salvage, he would pay his reſpects to them, with Preſents of every ſort; which unſatisfying anſwer not fuiting well with the covetouſneſs of the Captain and the Parſon, proved of ill conſequence to Mr. <hi>Orpen</hi> and Mr. <hi>Crump;</hi> For the Capt. and Mr. <hi>Bland</hi> ſet up for the Maſter and Crew, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them now Saints, whom but lately before they had condemned for Devills; they incenſed <hi>Edward Herbert</hi> the high Sherrif, a man of no ſmall <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Charles Monk</hi> Eſq; Collector of the County of <hi>Kerry,</hi> againſt Mr. <hi>Orpen</hi> and Mr. <hi>Crump,</hi> as tho' they were the only perſons that had deſtroyed the Ship and Cargo; And had forced the Maſter by head and ſhoulders out of the Ship; And having obtained from the Maſter and Paſſenger what <hi>Orpen,</hi> had refuſed to give
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:205961:16"/> upon the requeſt of that moſt diſingenious Letter, They ſtill continued to raiſe and foment divers evil reports, eſpecially againſt Mr. <hi>Orpen,</hi> as though he had been, not only the principal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer of the Ship, but that he had alſo contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the burning of Mr. <hi>Palmer's</hi> houſe: Haſte is now the neceſſity; and Major <hi>Steers</hi> the Grand Informer of the County of <hi>Kerry,</hi> was poſted away to <hi>Dublin,</hi> to fill that City with the noiſe. The <hi>Sh.</hi> joines with the Capt. and Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> and repreſents <hi>Orpen</hi> as a perſon very obnoxious and culpable in the whole proceeding of the Ship. What cannot a man accompliſh, tho' never ſo ill a member? Can he want Friends while he has any thing to give away? The Sh. the Cap. &amp; Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> have received Preſents from the Maſter, Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whom they immediately reſtored to their reputation again; and Mr. <hi>Orpen</hi> is as ſoon traduced to the World: vvho if he had been but earlier in <hi>Preſents</hi> then the Maſter, had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly bore the Bell; But neglecting to pay the Twenty Guinnyes which the Sh. deſired to have, as a br. or gift, and for refuſing comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to an unlawful Requeſt of a Miniſter, is now under thoſe dangers which are preacht out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him and <hi>Crump,</hi> in the percloſe of Mr. <hi>Bl</hi>'s Letter.</p>
            <p>The Capt. having carry'd away ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable <label type="milestone">

            <p>Now let any unbyast man conſider the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that part of the Country, and how ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the poor inhabitants thereof are to entertain Toryes in their houſes, when Capt. <hi>Gregoryes</hi> Soldiers have made ſuch neighbour-hood with them, which is not obſevable altogether in them only, for the Cap. himſelf who lives by the ſword, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">appendix page </seg>35</label> whoſe trade is to fight, and receives the Kings pay upon that account, is of reſolution as far from engaging the Toryes as his Soldiers are from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at War with them.

            <p>But to return again to the Ship, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king five days, digreſſion, as the Maſter did, for he <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">appendix page </seg>45</label> came not nigh her again until the 7th of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Monk</hi> perſwaded him to go on board, and then he made but about an hours ſtay, and went not to her again until the 12th where <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">appendix page </seg>46</label> he ſtay'd about another hour (Leaving one Mr. <hi>Richard Clarke</hi> to look after things on board) who until that day never went to concern <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">appendix page </seg>10</label> himſelf with the Ship, or any thing belonging to her: But the work being over for ſeveral days before, and all the Salvable part of the Goods (except ſome damnified Ginger, and the Fuſtick, which lay in the Balaſt) being already brought away by Mr. <hi>Orpen;</hi> Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> Rumidg'd for an hour or two up and down her hold, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Decks; and then left her, and the Maſter went not nigh her any more until the 15th. Now
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:205961:18"/> had the Maſter any manner of inclination for the preſerving of the Ship and Goods, he would not have lain away from her, while her Decks could be kept dry; Nay, tho' he were forced to lye in his cloaths all the time. All this while the Maſter, Paſſengers and Seamen never mention'd <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">appendix page </seg>11</label> any thing of the holes that were bored in the Ship, but kept it private until about the 10th of <hi>February,</hi> that the Country began to ring of it. For it ſeemes the Mate or Carpenter as they tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel'd, had made diſcovery thereof to ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that brought the account of it back to <hi>Kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mare.</hi> Then and never before, the Maſter own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there were holes bored in the Breadroom thorow her bottom, and that he did it pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to lodge her in the ſtrand, that by the weight of water in her hold, ſhe might Sit the faſter from beating; But ſure he will not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">appendix page </seg>22</label> it to his own Ignorance that he knew not that ſhe was but 10 foot in the Hold and that ſhe lay in 15 foot water in that place.</p>
            <p>During theſe Tranſactions, the Maſter, Mr. <hi>Myars,</hi> Mr. <hi>Row</hi> and Mr. <hi>Orpen,</hi> were very good Friends, ſave that one Firebrand was caſt in among them by Capt. <hi>Gregory,</hi> by Stirring up both ſides to ſpeak hard of each other, and carry'd the ſame from one to t'other; which loſt nothing in the carriage; ſo that he raiſ'd ſome heats which laſted not above a day or two; and it appears, that hitherto Cap. <hi>Gregory's</hi> incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaryes, took no great root among them, for that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:205961:19"/> the Maſter and theſe Paſſengers went frequently to eat and drink at Mr. <hi>Orpen's</hi> houſe; and upon the 11th of <hi>February</hi> after dinner, all three call'd him aſide, and told him, how well ſatisfied they were with his behaviour in that affair of the Ship and Goods, and deſired him to take the trouble <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">appendix page </seg>45</label> of the future mannagment thereof, promiſing <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">appendix page </seg>5</label> that he ſhould have his Salvage, and that they reſolved to go together for <hi>England;</hi> but would firſt make a conveyance of all to him, and he to deliver up the ſame to them or their Orders upon <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">appendix page </seg>45</label> demand, after allowing him his Salvage; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they call'd Mr. <hi>Monk,</hi> and having made him acquainted with what they had motion'd to Mr. <hi>Orpen,</hi> they pray'd the favour of him to draw writings between them to that effect: and in the evening, they took leave of Mr. <hi>Orpen,</hi> and every one went to his uarters, and Mr. <hi>Monk</hi> ſpent a conſiderable part of the night in drawing the Inſtruments.</p>
            <p>But the Sh. who lay all the while in ambuſh for a graſp at the Goods, lodg'd in the ſame Houſe with Mr. <hi>Monk,</hi> and by ſome means pry'd into the Writings, and next morning he came along with Mr. <hi>Monk,</hi> accompany'd with Cap. <hi>Gregory,</hi> to <hi>Killowen,</hi> where they found the Maſter, the two Paſſengers, and Mr. <hi>Orpen,</hi> very friendly together. Now or never was the time for the Sh. to ſet them at variance, which indeed he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd with a witneſs: For he plainly ſaw that he was at that inſtant like to be put by from ever
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:205961:19"/> having any concern with theſe Goods: And there upon, in vehemency and wrath he inſinuated to the Maſter and Paſſengers, That himſelf vvas high Sh. of the County, a Juſtice of peace of the County, Lieut. of the County, vvho could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Army, as vvell as the Militia of the County; and vvhat was it that he could not do in the County? And withall told them ſoberly, that they were under ſome cenſures for caſting away their Ship, and deſtroying the Cargo; and that he, and only he, could ſet them right with their Owners in <hi>England,</hi> and with the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Ireland;</hi> And then turn'd to ſome old Law-Book, directing (as he pretended) that all Wrecks ought to be depoſited with the Sheriff. The valiant Cap. <hi>Gregory,</hi> (who had made them underſtand by the daily Out-rages of himſelf and <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">appendix page </seg>40</label> his Men, that he govern'd indeed with no leſs Arbitrarineſs than the high Sh. and as Deſpotical <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">appendix page </seg>41</label> as he for his Life) entertain'd them with his Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Rhetorick, hovv abſolute he vvas in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Government and Command: Yet that himſelf and the high Sh. vvere but as one Man, vvho being a perſon vvell practic'd in Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, could either raiſe or depreſs them as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and adviſed them to quit all others, and ſtick to the Sh. <hi>One Horſe Nabs another;</hi> and People of a ſort ſoon agree: The high Sh. the Cap. the Maſter, <hi>Jacob Myars,</hi> and <hi>Peter Row,</hi> ſprung preſently as a ſworn Covey, and Mr. <hi>Orpen</hi> was no more to be conſulted with, but look'd upon as
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:205961:20"/> a Perſon qualified to ruine their Councils and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.</p>
            <p>From hence forth Cap. <hi>Gregory,</hi> the high Sh. and Mr <hi>Bl.</hi> (being well ſweetned with ſome of the beſt Sugars) became Patrons to the Maſter, and theſe Paſſengers, &amp; by the frequent incurſions of the firſt, That part of the Country about <hi>Kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mare,</hi> was haraſs'd as though it had been the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes Quarters; for he had always a ravenous pack at his heels, who prey'd upon the Country day and night, without paying for the Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which they exacted from the poor People in their continual marches, under the notion of ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Ships Goods, Tumbling and toſſing all their little houſholdry, and janting it in that manner, from houſe to houſe, they beat and wounded the Men, Raviſh'd Women and Maids, and ſet Houſes afire; But when they had Forced the People to give them all their mony, they put out the fire again. Theſe doings paſt under the notion of ſerving the Owners, who have alſo paid dearly for their Services, and had they thought fit to have conſulted Mr. <hi>Orpen,</hi> he had made appear the many havocks which were commited by the Maſter, Paſſengers, the high Sh.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:205961:20"/> to the Government, in the behalf of his <hi>Sweet Clyents,</hi> and becomes Merchant for great part of the Goods, and waited at <hi>Killmare</hi> for an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (in anſwer to his Letter) to Seiz both Ship and Goods into his own poſſeſſion; and ſo by his power of Shrievalty, Replevins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to wreſt from Mr. <hi>Orpen</hi> and the reſt of the Engliſh of thoſe parts, what was due to them for Salvage; and by his merit of that kind, to win the Owners favour, into ſome great <hi>Preſents</hi> for his good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, whom the Maſter and Paſſengers in the mean time viſited by their Letters, Setting forth the worthyneſs of the Sh. as the only perſen fit to be truſted in the whole concerns of the Ship and Goods; and how highly he had appeared againſt Mr. <hi>Orpen</hi> and the reſt of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Orpen</hi> and the Engliſh Petitioned to the Government againſt the proceedings of the Sh. who waited big with expectation of a power to ſeize, &amp;c. But no ſuch thing appearing, nor finding the ſucceſs he wiſht for, and that his Letter was not ſo taking as expected, Mr. <hi>Myars</hi> haſtens away to <hi>Dublin,</hi> well trained to every particular requiſite to back the Letter of the 13th, who ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived there about the 5th of <hi>March,</hi> and on the 6th made his examination ready, and on the 7th was examined before the Hon<hi rend="sup">ble</hi> Sr. <hi>Henry Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin,</hi> one of the Barrons of the Exchequer, which Examination ſcream'd ſo loudly againſt the beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior of Mr. <hi>Orpen</hi> and the Engliſh, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment

Sh. to that purpoſe, who was overjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee the growth of his labour and wit arrive to that perfection, and put the Warrant in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution after a ſtrange manner; Not by himſelf, or any of his under-Officers, but employ'd Serjeant <hi>Fullerton</hi> (brother in law to Capt. <hi>Gregory</hi>) who with ten Muſquetteers came to Mr. <hi>Orpens</hi> houſe, and took him priſoner, without letting him know upon what account, other then that their Capt. had commanded them to do it; He askt them, was it by warrant or by order? The Serjeant told him that he had a warrant; But would not be prevailed upon to ſhew it, or to give the leaſt hint of the purport thereof. But at length he ſaid that it was for Harbouring of Toryes, and gave out to the neighbourhood <hi>(inter alia)</hi> that 'twas for ſupplying the Torys with ten quarts of Powder.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding that Mr. <hi>Orpen</hi> ſeemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned at theſe proceedings; Yet the new Engliſh Collony which he brought into that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:205961:21"/> Country, began to repine at their misfortune, and wiſht that they had never come out of <hi>England;</hi> And finding him thus troubled on account of <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">appendix page </seg>33</label> Toryes, whom they knew to be one of the greateſt ſuppreſſors of Malefactors throwout the <label type="milestone">

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">appendix page </seg>39</label> he was no way guilty of ſuch a crime, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that the Sh.

The Serjeant and party took away Mr. <hi>Orp.</hi> out of his houſe in great hurry, not affording him time to put on his cloaths, to the great glory of the high Sh. to ſee his priſoner carry'd thro' the Towns with ten Muſquetteers; a very unpracticable way of executing the warrant of the Civil Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Orpen</hi> is now Priſoner at <hi>Tralee,</hi> and by the 23th of <hi>March</hi> was Examined, and Bail'd to appear the 26th, being the day that my Lord Chief Juſtice had appointed for the Tryal; which was bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Upon the 27th in the morning, a Bill of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment againſt <hi>Orpen</hi> and <hi>Crump,</hi> was found by the Grand Jury, for taking two Hogſheads of Sugar, and eight Hogſheads of Lime-Juyce, of the proper Goods of <hi>Peter Row,</hi> out of the Ship <hi>Laurel;</hi> In the afternoon they were call'd: but for want of Witneſſes to prove the Accuſative Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations, 'twas put off till next morning; and the Tryal could not yet be brought on, for want-of ſuch Witneſſes: Whereupon Mr. <hi>Orpen</hi> told the Court, That he confeſs'd to have ſaved ſuch Goods, and that he would prove the Maſter's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for it; and prayed to have the Tryal go on; not thinking what kind of Preparations were made againſt him. The Couragious Major <hi>Steers,</hi> who was principal Engine to inform againſt him in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and a chief Cock-Feather in the Jews Cap, was call'd to be Foreman of the Jury; <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus Morris,</hi> who was not of the County, but Agent for the Owners and Merchants, was the next call'd, both which were excepted againſt by <label type="milestone">

            <p>There were 14 Witneſſes more on the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſers behalves; but <hi>Bryen Kelly</hi> being ſnubb'd in Court by the high Sh. for giving any Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in favour of the Traverſers, and the reſt of Mr. <hi>Orpen</hi>'s Witneſſes being frighted by the Warrant for the pretended Felony, they held their Tongues, for fear that Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> whom they ſuſpected had contrived to have them thus falſly accuſed, ſhould with no leſs juſt proſecution pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail to have them Arraigned and Tryed for their Lives; fore-thinking that whoever had gone ſo far into ſuch a Ford, would leave nothing unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to wade quite thorow, to the utter Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, if not of their Perſons, at leaſt of their Purſes.</p>

            <p>This Affidavit is a Sample of the contrivances now on foot concerning a wedge of Gold, which Mr. <hi>Myars</hi> pretends he threw aſide under the bed when the Toryes entred the houſe; and by the Philoſophers Stone revers'd was turned into Braſs. But whether he threw it there or not, there was a lump of Metal taken up among the rubbiſh, and being delivered to M. <hi>Myars,</hi> he did at ſeveral times in the hearing of ſeveral Gentlemen, own and declare that it was the ſame lump or wedge which he had throwne by, and deſcribed it by the colour, ſhape, and ſize, and by ſeveral private marks, and particularly by two ſpecks or bubbles upon the upper ſurface thereof; Now whether he left any ſuch lump there as he pretends; or
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:205961:27"/> whether he would not, if he thought 'twere Gold, have laid his Challenge to any lump, were it the right one or no; or whether, if it were the right one, he had not a mind to deceive the right owner of it, and ſo cauſed a counterfeit to be made after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; or whether he was cheated in <hi>Jamaica,</hi> is yet a queſtion; But it admitts of this diſcourſe, that it's very manifeſt that the piece or lump which was delivered by Mr. <hi>Mabury</hi> to Mr. <hi>Myars,</hi> carryed the ſeveral marks and ſpecks upon the upper-ſide or upper ſurface, as the true piece had, which is indeed an infallible aſſurance (if Mr. <hi>Myars</hi> deſcription were true) that it is the right piece, be it Gold, Braſs, or any other Metal whatever; For though its in the power of any ordinary capacity that can run Metals, to imitate in ſome ſort in the bottom ſides or ends of the Counterfeit the marks of the true Piece, yet the ſpecks, or bubbles, or any other mark upon the upper ſurface, are accidentals in caſting, (and in a coat as different from the reſt, as the upper coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of a Pann-pudding differeth from every part of the Geometricall ſuperficies of the ſides and bottom) and not to be imitated by the beſt of Artiſts; and for further ſatisfaction in this point, Enquire at all the Laboratories and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deries within Humane management, and they will tell you that its as impoſſible to raiſe <hi>(ad libitum)</hi> a ſingle bubble or two (or more properly hony-comb) of exact ſhape and place upon the upper ſurface (that ſide only in ſuch flat caſtings
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:205961:27"/> being lyable to this kind of windy ſputter) as it is in the power of a Phyſician to lay a well man to bedd and bring a ſmall pox through his Skin in exact numbers where and when he pleaſes; and what man will take two pails of water of equal Cylinder and Depth, and having ſet out upon the margins the 32 points with their Aliquots, and by the plounce of a Pebble-ſtone having raiſed a bubble accidentally in one of the pails, ſhall afterwards undertake that in the dropping a thouſand pebbles more into the other pail, to raiſe a ſingle bubble of exact ſhape point and diſtance from the Center, with the former? And if he ever accompliſheth it, he may afterwards ſay that its a thouſand times more impoſſible to raiſe <hi>(ad libitum)</hi> in any Counterfeit a hony comb of exact depth, ſhape, and place, with the copy. Notwithſtanding that Ca. <hi>Greg.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> were unſucceſſfull in their adventure if they deſigned to lay out their twenty pounds a piece with <hi>Edward Dunigan</hi> for this intended ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which in ſome parts of the Kingdom, and among ſome ſort of folks, migh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:205961:28"/> would lay to the ground all whom they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the ſlaughter, to ſave their own Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dits; ſo that not above two or three of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try are yet got to Swear, upon this particular; one being a Black-Smith, and a very boon Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion at the Pot and Noggin, and has often join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Miniſter <hi>Fervently</hi> in that ſort, and ſometimes it has been obſerved that a few Pots of Ale ſhall prevail more with a drunken Fellow, than Tvventy Pounds vvith another. This Fellovv has ſvvorn, as it's ſaid, That Mr. <hi>Mabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> ask'd him, <hi>Could he caſt a Piece of Braſs of ſome certain ſize or ſhape, which would ſerve his turn?</hi> Or to that effect. But this Affidavit being a very ſlight one, its ſuppoſed to be no more than the price of ſome ſmall Reckoning at the Alehouſe. But if he ſwears thus far it ſelf for nothing, or in <hi>Forma Pauperis,</hi> what will his Affidavit be, when the Miniſter ſhall receive Orders from his Owners to lay out the Tvventy Pounds? Do they play upon the Eaſineſs of his ſoft Temper? Or vvill they uſe him as the Blind do a Staff, vvhich they thruſt out before them to grope out their vvay among the Sloughs, to ſave their Feet from the Mire, and their Heads from knocking againſt the Walls?</p>

               <p>Now whether the Jew, the Maſter, the high Sh.

               <p>Who were the chief Projectors to ruine a rich ſhip, thereby to gain an opportunity to carry off the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure behind the Curtain? Mr. <hi>Lyell</hi> may tell you that it was Mr. <hi>Myars</hi> and himſelf.</p>

                  <hi>TImothy Turtane</hi> of <hi>Toaſiſta</hi> in the County of <hi>Kerry,</hi> Mariner, came before me this day, and made Oath, That on the Twenty-Eighth day of <hi>January</hi> laſt, the Ship <hi>Laurel</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> came up the River of <hi>Kilmare</hi> with her Fore-ſail and Main-ſail looſe in diſorder, without any perſon on board her, and ſaith that about ſeven in the Morning ſhe drove up to <hi>Cappanacoſſy</hi> upon the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rand; and about the ſame time the Maſter came to <hi>Cappanacoſſy</hi> with ſeveral Bags of Money, carried by his Ships Company, and went all together into the Houſe of <hi>Dermot Mac Owen,</hi> about a quarter of a mile off the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hip; and ſaith that the Maſter remained there about eight hours, without ſeeming to take any notice of the Ship, which drove to and fro in his ſight, as the Tyde ebb'd and flow'd; but ſaith, that the Maſter ſent for a quarter Cask of Rum, and about one hundred pounds of Sugar, wherewith the Maſter and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, together with ſome of the Countrey People, made themſelves merry aſhore, while the Ship was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving up and down with the Flood and Ebb before their Faces; and ſaith, that towards the evening the Maſter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ent on Board, as did likewiſe this Deponent, and the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:205961:49"/> Ship was ſtill driving to and fro, without any Anchor dropt; whereupon this Deponent ask'd the Maſter to put out an Anchor; the Maſter anſwer'd, That his Cable was not in order; this Deponent told him that he this Deponent would put out the Kedge-Anchor that had a ſmall Warp to it; the Maſter told him he might let it alone; however this Deponent by the Maſters conſent at length dropt that Anchor; and ſaith that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter never cauſed any other Anchor to be put out, but that the Ship rid out wholly by that ſmall Warp until the Maſter deſerted her, which was the third day after, notwithſtanding that there were then on board the Sheet Anchor, and ſmall Bower, with Cables ſuitable; and ſaith that he called to the Maſter, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>old him that his Ship was Tight, and that the worſt Weather made but very little Seas in that place, and that ſhe was in no manner of danger; and told the Maſter that if he would permit him, that he and his Boat-men wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d ſave the Ship, and get her off immediately. The Maſter then bid this Deponent hold his Tongue, and that he would be this Deponents Friend. The Deponent finding that the Maſter was then reſolved to caſt her away, came no more near him, but told every Body he met with, that he was ſo reſolved; and ſaith that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter did accordingly leave her moſt ſhamefully at a time when a Man could wade to her ſide, as there did five men, who having no Boat, waded to her ſide, and went on Board, preſently after the Maſter and all the Men quitted her; And ſaith, that two Days before the Ship was ſo deſerted by the Maſter and Men aforeſaid, the Maſter cauſed the Men to open the Hatches, and take out ſeveral Goods, and made havock thereof to the Countrey People. And ſaith, that one <hi>Ned Dunegon</hi> did alſo profes to ſave the Ship the firſt day ſhe came to <hi>Cappanacoſſy,</hi> and the Maſter would not abide to hear of it; but <hi>Dunegon</hi> being inceſſant upon the matter, the Maſter got him well drubb'd, and turn'd aſhore. And
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:205961:49"/> ſaith, that the Mate of a Canary Ship was likewiſe on Board, when this Deponent diſcours'd the Maſter to have his Ship ſaved; and this Mate likewiſe told the Maſter that he the Mate would get her off preſently; the Maſter told the Mate that he ſhould meddle with what concern'd him. And this Deponent verily believes that the Maſter and ſome of the Paſſengers had a Deſign to carry away the money which was in the Ship, and to caſt her away, that it might be pretended that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and all was loſt together; and ſaith that moſt of that Country believes the ſame. And ſaith if the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had not cauſed holes to be bor'd in the bread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room through the bottom of the ſhip, he could not well have caſt her away in ſuch a place where ſhe lay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome artificial prejudice done firſt unto her. And ſaith that but very little of the ſugar remain'd undamnified being in a manner all ſpoil'd by the water which came into the ſaid Ship by means of the holes which were made through the bottom before the maſter deſerted her.</p>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:205961:54"/> the Maſter and Company brought ſeveral bags of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney with them to that Houſe; and this Deponent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd with the maſter, and found that the Ship came from <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and that the maſter and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny had quitted the ſaid Ship at <hi>Black-Water,</hi> about two miles Weſt ward of <hi>Cappanacoſſy,</hi> and admired that they did not bring the Ship into <hi>Black-Water,</hi> being right before the Wind, which was then at S.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:205961:54"/> belonged to her; but at length by the perſwaſions of this Deponent and others, the Maſter writ a Letter to one Mr. <hi>Thomas Palmer</hi> a Juſtice of the Peace in that Country, wherein he ſeemed to pretend that his Ship was in diſtreſs, and craved Aid, and mentioned in his Letter, that he had not a Sail left; and this Deponent ſaith, that next day he this Deponent was on board, and ſaw in the Gun Room 4 or 5 large Sails, which this Deponent believes were New Sails; and this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent ſaith, that in the Evening, Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> came to the Maſter at <hi>Cappanacoſſy</hi> on the 28th aforeſaid; and ſaith, that Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> diſcours'd the Maſter, and finding that he had great quantities of Gold and Silver at <hi>Dermot mac Owen</hi>'s Houſe, Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> then told the Maſter that he was in danger of loſing his Money, for that the Tories were ſaid to be hard by. Upon which apprehenſions of the Tories, the Maſter with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and Paſſengers, went on board again that Night, about an hour after Sun ſet. But this Deponent veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believes that if the Maſter had not been afraid of the Tories, that neither the Maſter, nor any of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany or Paſſengers, had ever returned again to the Ship, for that the Maſter, Paſſengers, and Ships Company had divided the Money and Gold amongſt themſelves, to every one a ſhare, before the Letter was ſent to Mr. <hi>Palmer,</hi> and remembers that the Maſter bid his Boy to carry his, <hi>viz.</hi> the Maſter's ſhare of the Money, and lay it by in the Window; and added in theſe words, <hi>That every one had his ſhare of the money divided and given to him, and let every man ſecure his own ſhare;</hi> And ſaith, that the mate and men declared that the Ship owed them a years Wages, and ſwore that ſhe ſhould never owe them any more; that they had divided what Money was in the Ship among them ſelves, that they would be gone, ſome to <hi>Cork,</hi> ſome to <hi>Kinſale, &amp;c.</hi> And this Deponent further ſaith, That while the Maſter, and the company, and paſſengers aforeſaid,

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:205961:66"/> and bid him go with the party to the Toryes who were then before their faces, and if the Toryes ſhould not ſtay for them, to go no further, but to return back again; whereupon this Deponent, with the other Engliſh and the Soldiers, left the Captain upon the hill to behold their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and went towards the Toryes, who had refreſht themſelves (while the Captain and the party were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering) and made all the haſt they could away; and this Deponent and the reſt of the party ſoon came to the Ground where the Toryes had been, And found that they had gained half a mile in that miles purſuit; but when they came there, the Corporal, according to the Captains orders would not ſuffer the Soldiers to purſue any further; And ſaith, that with much ado. he this Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, Mr. <hi>Benjamin Taylor,</hi> and one <hi>Nicholas Rouſe,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with three of the Soldiers to keep on with them ſtill after the Toryes; And ſaith, that theſe Six men came up near the Toryes in leſs then a Miles purſuit, and fired ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſhots in among them; But ſaith, that conſidering that they were but Six to this great Number of Toryes, and that the reſt of the Soldiers ſtay'd behind; they did not think it prudent to purſue them any longer, but returned again to the reſt of the Soldiers, where they had left them; And as ſoon as they came to them, the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral beat the three Soldiers for going beyond their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, And this Deponent ſaith that he verily believes that if Cap. <hi>Gregory</hi> had ſuffer'd his men to go on with this Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and the Engliſh of the Country, They had in all pro, bability kill'd and taken the greateſt part of theſe Toryes, It being in the Morning in an open Country and a very fine clear day.</p>

               <p>ON the 28th of <hi>January</hi> 1693. in the Morning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 7 or 8 a Clock, the Ship <hi>Laurell</hi> of <hi>London</hi> drove up to <hi>Cappanacoſſy,</hi> and came on ſhore there about 2 or 3 Miles from my Houſe, and about Noon, the Maſter writ to me that ſhe was in diſtreſs, and had not a Sail left, and deſired my Aid, whereupon I went to him and found him and all his Men aſhore, at the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Dermot Sulivan</hi> of <hi>Cappanacoſſy,</hi> making themſelves and ſome of the Country people merry with Rum and Sugar and that the Maſter, Paſſengers and Company had forſaken the Ship at <hi>Black-Water-Mouth,</hi> about two Miles below <hi>Cappanacoſſy,</hi> without leaving any Soul on board her; when I ſaw how the Ship was, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed the Maſter, Paſſengers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to betake themſelves to their Ship again, ſhe being paſt danger, and promiſed him all the Aſſiſtance I could; but the Maſter ſeem'd to have no mind to go on board her any more, or to have any regard to her Preſervation, until I underſtanding that they had ſome Bags of Money and Treaſure with them aſhore, I told them that the Country abounded with Tories and ill people, and deſired them to carry their Money on Board, and ſtick to their Ship, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al told them, that ſhe was the beſt Gariſon in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; upon which Apprehenſions of the Tories, they haſtned on board again with their Money; I took leave of them that Evening, and ſent them about half a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Soldiers to Guard them, and ſent likewiſe ſeveral Boats and Men to bring her away to a good Harbour; but ſome of them returned again, and told me, that the Maſter and Men on board minded norhing but drinking, and none of them took any manner of care for the Ship; next Morning about 10 a Clock, the Mate, one Mr. <hi>Myars</hi> a Jew, <hi>Peter Row,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Spyers,</hi> with ſeveral of the Ships company came aſhore to my Houſe, and brought with them 2 or 3 Sea Cheſts, wherein I concluded were ſome Changes of Cloaths to refreſh themſelves aſhore; not in the leaſt thinking they had
<pb n="[43]" facs="tcp:205961:69"/> brought their Money in theſe Cheſts, having before told them, that their Ship was the beſt Gariſon in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and after they had Eaten and Drank, I rid down to the Ship along with Mr. <hi>Myars,</hi> and took along with me my Son-in-Law Mr. <hi>Orpen,</hi> who had judgment in Shipping, to adviſe with the Maſter to get the Ship into a Harbour, who went on Board with the ſaid <hi>Myars,</hi> leaving me on ſhore, where he ſtay'd about 2 hours, and returned back again in the Evening with Mr. <hi>Myars,</hi> and among other Diſcourſes at my Houſe, the ſaid <hi>Peter Row</hi> gave me a Note of ſome Goods which he had on board, and deſired me to employ ſome perſons to ſave them; whereupon I employ'd my Son <hi>Orpen</hi> to do it; That Night being the 29th about midnight, the Tories came and ſet my Houſe on fire in ſeveral places, and fired ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Shots in at the Doors and Windows, and we fired at them again; but the fierceneſs of the Fire increaſed, and the Key being loſt, we were forced to break open the Door, and ſubmit our ſelves to the Tories, who forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with entred the Houſe, and Mr. <hi>Myars</hi> ſhew'd them the Cheſt which had the Treaſure, and they dragg'd it out and brake it open, and carried away what they found in it; all this while Mr. <hi>Myars,</hi> or any other Body, never told me that they had brought this Treaſure to my Houſe, until after my Houſe was Burnt and Robb'd; the next day being the 80th, I was told the Maſter quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Ship, and left her to the Country; all this in <hi>Verbo Sacerdotis,</hi> I aver to be true, as</p>

               <p>I Had ſooner Anſwer'd yours of the 10th, but that I was then from home, at one of the Remoteſt Places in my Diſtrict, occaſioned by the coming of the <hi>London-Guinycoaſt Frigot</hi> homeward bound at <hi>Ventry</hi> near <hi>Dingle,</hi> which having very narrowly eſcaped the Seas, had well nigh Periſhed in the Harbour; for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Bay, ſhe ran up towards <hi>Caſtlemain,</hi> not knowing the Land; but our Boat going out timely, gave her a Waft and brought her into ſafe Anchoring: I ſuppoſe you have ſufficiently heard of the Privateers coming into the River of <hi>Killmare,</hi> and taking the Ships thence; they had likewiſe Intelligence and Deſign to carry off this; but my going, and ſending Expreſs after Expreſs, partly prevented it; the Captain of her, tho' his Chance ſuch, is a Rugged, Reſolute, Stout Fellow; that will ſtand to and defend her to the laſt, ſo that I reckon her in no great Danger, unleſs he be very much over marcht, while the few Soldiers and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh that are there, and he cotten ſo well together. During my being there, I received by 2 Expreſſes No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of another homeward bound Ship the <hi>Laurel,</hi> alſo of <hi>London,</hi> ſtranded within the River of <hi>Kilmare,</hi> which being very unuſual, haſtned me from the utmoſt corner over the Mountain to her Relief; but alas, I came too lat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The latter were in a manner deſtroy'd before he went aboard by the Rable, and water, which was got into her, eſpecially the Sugar. When I came there, I found he had taken much pains and care therein and appeared ready to give me an account of what was ſaved, and how he had laid the goods with the beſt ſafety he could into the moſt convenient houſes for that purpoſe; and the Maſter and Paſſengers promiſed he ſhould have a reaſonable ſalvage; as for the money which they were Robbed of, 'twas car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed aſhore privatly by themſelves; So that he had no hand in ſaving of that; if he had, it had been better for them, for he would undoubtedly have managed with more prudence. But that Reverend worthy man Mr. <hi>Palmer,</hi> is ruined by it; having his houſe (where the money lay) and all his Subſtance burnt by the Toryes. Next morning after I came there, I got the Maſter to go aboard, who I muſt ſay, in the condition the Ship was then in, had but little regard of the whole; for he ſtayed but ſome few hours on board; ſo that I had ſomwhat to do to perſwade him to go to her again till about the 12th I did again importune him

He ſhewed me an imperfect Envoyce but not the former Maſters Pocket Book; for you muſt conceive that this man was not Shipt as Maſter, but the Maſter dying at Sea, he appointed this Man to conduct the Ship home.
